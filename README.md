Challenge One - anagram Problem

This code contains a single class for doing a character comparison between the two given string and returns the number of characters as result


Challenge two - classification Problem

This is a classification Problem using Sklearn Framework

	1. SVM classifier is choosen as it could provide a better result in this scenario because of the 76 numeric features with non-linear relationship
	2. Grid search is used to narrow down the optimal Hyper parameter for the give condition of the dataset
	3. The buzz and non buzz target class is not evenly distributed which is also one of the reason to pick the SVM classifer - 'poly' Kernel can fit such higher dimension datasets effectively eventhough Interpretability is low.
